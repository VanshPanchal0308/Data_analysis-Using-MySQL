# Data_analysis-Using-MySQL

## **What is DataBase ?**
- A database is a storage system for a collection of data. In computing, applications will retrieve and store information in the database.
 ## **What is MySQL ?**
 - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle.
 - MySQL falls into the relational database category. Relational databases divide, organize, and store data across different tables.
 - These tables are then linked together by defining relationships to one another. 

## **Aim Of Project:**
This project involves the analysis of a dataset from a pizza shop, which contains details such as pizza names, order IDs, order times and dates, prices, pizza categories, pizza sizes, and more. The goal of this project was to explore and retrieve useful information from the dataset using MySQL.

## **About Project:**
The project is structured into three categories of questions: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced, each designed to deepen the understanding of SQL querying and data manipulation techniques.

- **Basic :** Simple queries to retrieve specific information such as order details, pizza categories, and basic statistics.

- **Intermediate :**More complex queries involving data aggregation, filtering, and grouping to uncover trends and insights.

- **Advance :**Advanced queries that require joining multiple tables, subqueries, and more intricate data analysis to answer complex business questions.

This project is a great example of how SQL can be used in Business Analytics to gain valuable insights from a dataset and is a useful resource for anyone looking to improve their SQL skills.
